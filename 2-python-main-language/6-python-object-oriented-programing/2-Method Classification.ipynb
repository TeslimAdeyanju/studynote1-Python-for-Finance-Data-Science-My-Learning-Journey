    "\n",
    "Class methods are methods that are called on the class itself, not on a specific object instance. Therefore, it belongs to a class level, and all class instances share a class method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class method is bound to the class and not the object of the class. It can access only class variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can modify the class state by changing the value of a class variable that would apply across all the class objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In method implementation, if we use only class variables, we should declare such methods as class methods. The class method has a `cls` as the first parameter, which refers to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods are used when we are dealing with factory methods. Factory methods are those methods that return a class object for different use cases. Thus, factory methods create concrete implementations of a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class method can be called using `ClassName.method_name()` as well as by using an object of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How To Define Class Method**\n",
    "- Any method we create in a class will automatically be created as an instance method. We must explicitly tell Python that it is a class method using the `@classmethod` decorator or `classmethod()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class methods are defined inside a class, and it is pretty similar to defining a regular function. Like, inside an instance method, we use the `self` keyword to access or modify the instance variables. Same inside the class method, we use the `cls` keyword as a first parameter to access class variables. Therefore the class method gives us control of changing the class state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may use a variable named differently for cls, but it is discouraged since self is the recommended convention in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The class method can only access the class attributes, not the instance attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to define class methods depending on the programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a `decorator`: This is the preferred way in modern programming languages like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the `classmethod()` function (legacy syntax):This method is considered less common and sometimes discouraged"

    "* The second approach directly modifies the class attribute outside of any method. While this approach is simpler and may seem more straightforward, it lacks the explicitness and encapsulation provided by the class method approach. It's easier to overlook or accidentally modify class attributes in unintended ways when directly modifying them like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better Choice:***\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach, using a class method, is generally considered the better choice. It promotes encapsulation and maintains better control over how class attributes are modified. It provides a clear interface for modifying class attributes and helps ensure that modifications are done in a controlled manner. Additionally, it allows for easier maintenance and modification of the code in the future. Therefore, using a class method to modify class attributes is often preferred over direct modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"better\" approach depends on the specific requirements and design of your program. However, generally speaking, using class methods to modify class variables is often considered a better approach for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Using class methods provides a clearer interface for modifying class variables. It encapsulates the logic for modifying the variable within a method, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility: Class methods allow for more flexibility in the implementation. You can include additional logic, such as validation or error handling, within the method. This helps ensure that modifications to the class variable are done in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consistency: Using class methods promotes consistency in the codebase. If you have multiple places where you need to modify the same class variable, you can use the same class method throughout the codebase, ensuring uniformity and reducing the chances of errors or inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ease of Refactoring: If you later need to change how the class variable is modified, using class methods makes it easier to refactor the code. You only need to update the implementation of the class method, rather than searching for and updating every occurrence of direct assignments to the class variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It aims to restrict access to certain components of an object and only expose the necessary interfaces for interacting with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world and preventing direct access to it. Instead, access to the internal state is controlled through well-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Hiding: Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal state of an object by making its attributes private or protected. Private attributes cannot be accessed from outside the class, while protected attributes have limited access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access Control: Encapsulation enables you to control the access to the data and methods of a class. You can define which parts of the class are accessible from outside and which are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Information Hiding: Encapsulation promotes information hiding by exposing only the necessary information about an object's behavior, while hiding its implementation details. This helps in reducing complexity and making the code more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modularity: Encapsulation encourages modularity by organizing related data and behaviors into a single unit (class). This improves code organization and makes it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Security: Encapsulation enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and ensuring that data is accessed and modified only through controlled interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, encapsulation is a key principle of OOP that promotes data hiding, access control, information hiding, modularity, and security. It helps in creating well-structured, maintainable, and secure code by encapsulating the implementation details within classes and exposing only the necessary interfaces to the outside world.\n"

    "An instance method is a function that's defined within a class and is specifically tied to instances (or objects) of that class. In simpler terms, it's a special kind of function that operates on a particular object's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about instance methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instance methods can access and modify both instance variables and class variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires an object: Unlike regular functions, you can't call an instance method directly. You need to create an object (an instance) of the class first, and then use that object to call the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operates on object's data: Instance methods typically have access to the object's attributes (data) and can manipulate them. This allows them to perform actions specific to that particular object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Common use cases: Instance methods are essential for defining the behavior of objects. They handle tasks like modifying the object's state, performing calculations based on its data, or interacting with other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an analogy: Think of a class as a blueprint for creating houses. An instance method would be like a specific function designed for a particular house, like a \"turn on lights\" method. You would need a built house (the object) to use this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a class in Python, instance methods are used regularly. To work with an instance method, we use the self keyword. We use the self keyword as the first parameter to a method. The self refers to the current object."

This parameter represents the instance (object) that the method is called on. You can then use self to access the object's attributes and perform operations specific to that object. Instance variables are not shared between objects. Instead, every object has its copy of the instance attribute. Using the instance method, we can access or modify the calling object’s attributes. Instance methods are defined inside a class, and it is pretty similar to defining a regular function.\n",

    "In simple terms, a Python static method is a function that belongs to a class but doesn't access or modify any specific instance or class variables. It's like a standalone function that is defined within a class for organizational purposes.\n",

    "Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standalone Function: Unlike instance methods (which operate on specific instances of a class) and class methods (which operate on the class itself), a static method doesn't depend on any instance or class data. It's just a regular function that happens to be defined inside a class.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here, the static method has the following advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consume Less memory:** Instance methods are object too, and creating them has a cost. Having a static method avoids that. Let’s assume you have ten employee objects and if you create gather_requirement() as a instance method then Python have to create a ten copies of this method (seperate for each object) which will consume more memeory. On the other hand static method has only one copy per class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "kelly = Employee('Kelly', 12000, 'ABC Project')\n",
    "jessa = Employee('Jessa', 7000, 'XYZ Project')\n",
    "\n",
    "# false\n",
    "# because seperate copy of instance method is created for each object\n",
    "print(kelly.work is jessa.work)\n",
    "\n",
    "# True\n",
    "# because only one copy is created\n",
    "# kelly and jess objects share the same methods\n",
    "print(kelly.gather_requirement is jessa.gather_requirement)\n",
    "\n",
    "# True\n",
    "print(kelly.gather_requirement is Employee.gather_requirement)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **To Write Utility functions:** Static methods have limited use because they don’t have access to the attributes of an object (instance variables) and class attributes (class variables). However, they can be helpful in utility such as conversion form one type to another. The parameters provided are enough to operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Readabiltity:** Seeing the @staticmethod at the top of the method, we know that the method does not depend on the object’s state or the class state."
